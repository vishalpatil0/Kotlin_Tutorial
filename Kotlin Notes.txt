    -> Feature of kotlin : if you directly intilized the variable with value while decalring it then you don't need declare the data type.

4. Data Types:
    a. var & val used to declare the variable name.
    b. Variable which is declared using 'val' is basically a constant in kotlin.

5. Collections:
    a. Collections in kotlin are immutable.
    b. but mutableListOf can make them mutable

6. Nullability
    a. By putting ? after the data type you can get sure about the null type variable

7. If else
    a.If else in kotlin return the last statment of their blocks

8. Switch case
    a. In kotlin when is the switch case
    b. just like if-else blocks in when return the last statment

9. "Unit" is nothing in kotlin (void in java)
    "Any" is like object class in java.
